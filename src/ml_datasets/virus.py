    This dataset is used to predict the sub-cellular locations of proteins according to their sequences. It contains 207 sequences for Virus species. Both the GO (Gene ontology) features and PseAAC (including 20 amino acid, 20 pseudo-amino acid and 400 diptide components) are provided. There are 6 subcellular locations (viral capsid, host cell membrane, host endoplasm reticulum, host cytoplasm, host nucleus and secreted).
